The objective of this experiment is to illustrate the problem of false minima in the energy landscape and the concept of probabilistic update in Hopfield model to overcome the effect of false minima.
Following are the goals of the experiment:
- To understand the problem of error in recall of a desired pattern in a Hopfield Model.
- To illustrate the concept of probabilistic update in Hopfield model and the effect of temperature parameter on the probabilistic update of states.
