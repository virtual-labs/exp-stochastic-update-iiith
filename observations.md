- Take any state in the state transition diagram and observe the change in the probabilities of transition with change in temperature.
- Observe the trend of probability with temperature while transiting to a state with higher energy.
- Try annealing schedule for a couple of times with different set of temparatures, see whether the states settle to similar probabilities or different.
